\section{Requirements }

\subsection{Mechanical }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shall have a method of navigating through the field 
\item Shall have at least one pusher/puller hereby referred to as a pusher
for moving blocks around the field 
\item Shall fit in a 8in by 8in box at start of play and 18in cylinder during
all of play 
\item Shall have cad files made for each component 
\item Shall be able to move each pusher with at least a minimum of x m/s
in any direction 
\item Shall have a weight that is less than 5 lbs 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Electrical }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shall be able to sense items in front of the robot 
\item Shall be able to detect which side of the field each pusher is on 
\item Shall be able to detect the state of the pusher 
\item Shall be able to detect the velocity or absolute position of all wheels 
\item Shall have a motor controller to regulate current direction and amount
sent to each actuator 
\item Shall have electrical designs for circuit 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shall be able to interrupt when a pusher has entered the other side
of field 
\item Shall have a looping algorithm to move blocks to either side of the
field 
\item Shall be able to move the the robot autonomously across the field 
\item Shall be able to choose which side of the field blocks should be moved
to 
\item Shall use a robotic simulation environment to test the code 
\item Shall detect current state of pusher at initialization and move to
a designated initialization state for pusher Robot 
\item shall have a designated initialization state 
\item Shall use GitHub to version control the software 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety and logistics }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shall have a hard reset button that can be easily reached to turn
off all components of the robot 
\item Shall have a software reset button that returns the robot to initialization
state 
\item Shall have a active budget of 40 dollars and fabrication budget of
300 dollars 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}

\subsection{Mechanical }
\begin{enumerate}
\item We should use 4 holonomic wheels to help the robot navigate the stage.
This will help in maneuverability along with ease of motion planning.
Along with increase the speed in which we can orient pushers to start
pushing blocks.
\item Undetermined 
\item Undetermined 
\item Cad files will be made in NX and stored in Teams
\item Will use 4 parallax motors and a latch spring mechanism to activate
the pushers 
\item Undetermined
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Electrical}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We will use a combination of ultra sound sensors and a TOF (undetermined)
to sense in front of the robot 
\item Will use a QTI sensor to detect which side of the field we are one
\item A servo will be used to activate the latch spring mechanism and activatation
of the latch spring mechanism will indicate the state of the pushers.
\item All 4 parallax motors have built in absolute position sensors which
can be used to detect both the velocity and position of the wheels 
\item Undetermined
\item Undertermined in what format and where they will be stored 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{enumerate}
\item will have a interrupts that detect when the qti sensor has changed
fields 
\item Code flow to be determined will be stored on github
\item Code flow to be determined will be stored on github
\item Code flow to be determined will be stored on github
\item Will use ROS and gazebo to simualte the robot for virtual testing
and developement 
\item Will store whether the latch mechanism was activated or not 
\item Will be determined
\item Code can be found here : (Repo to be Created)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety and Logistics }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Will determine 
\item Will determine
\item Will verify against the BOMS
\end{enumerate}
